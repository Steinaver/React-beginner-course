This project was created as part of a hands-on React course.

Throughout the course, I gained experience with:

## React basics
- JSX syntax
- Component lifecycle
- Functional and class components

## Working with hooks
- useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useContext
- Creating custom hooks

## State management and data transfer
- Controlled and uncontrolled components
- Passing data via props (parent → child and child → parent)

## Routing and APIs
- React Router with public and private routes
- Working with the server via Axios

## Additional functionality
- Filtering, sorting, searching
- Lazy loading
- Infinite scroll
- Component decomposition

…and other practical features and optimizations.
